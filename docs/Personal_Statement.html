					<h6>"I choose to live my life sustainably with the goal of leaving as little impact on the environment as I can. Although, I am only just one person, I hope to see a movement during our generation to further protect the natural world, allowing for future generations to reap the same benefits. Throughout the past couple of years, I have begun to make significant changes in my lifestyle such as eating plant-based, reducing my waste and plastic use, as well as buying clothing secondhand or from sustainable brands. Initially, I was inspired to start eating a vegetarian diet because of the inhuman conditions of the animals. The meat industry is a manufacturing business that genetically breeds animals with the sole purpose of human consumption. Additionally, the environmental impacts from these industries ranges from excess water waste to the emissions dangerous of fossil fuels. After removing animals from my diet for two years, I decided to test myself and to see if I could eat a completely plant-based diet. transition from vegetarian to vegan was much easier that I thought and in turn made me eat healthier. Becoming vegan, also motivated me start cooking and trying different foods. I now find comfort in the entire vegan community and enjoy supporting local cafes and restaurants when possible. I am aware my dietary choices are not always an option for everyone in the world nor am I trying to convince anyone to become vegan. I just hope to increase awareness on the issue, informing others of their environmental impacts." - Anonymous, 22

						<h6>"I went plant-based because I was uncomfortable with how I looked, I wanted to lose weight. I lost the weight and began advocating for the ethics of vegetarianism and the health of veganism. I later learned that being mostly vegan was not enough. I went fully vegan after learning about the ethical dilemmas of vegetarianism and the environmental impact of factory farming. I am vegan because I cannot justify unnecessarily mutilating or ending the life of an animal in order for me to experience momentary pleasure." - Anonymous, 22

							<h6>"I choose to live my life sustainably because I want to reduce my impact on the environment. I started exploring the positive effects and benefits of living a vegan and more sustainable and healthier lifestyle through YouTube. I believe that we are responsible for leaving this planet better than how we found it. We need to live as no-waste and make conscious, ethical decisions on how we choose to live our lives. I endeavor to reduce my waste as much as I can, as well as supporting brands that consider our impact on the environment as well as animal health and rights. I hope that others will consider sustainable lifestyles, as even making small changes in your lifestyle can make cause a huge impact on our environment." - Anonymous, 21</h6>
